                <p>Greetings. I'm Jason, inspired-to-be full-stack software engineer.
                    I have a history of being a super-tech at <a href="https://sesindiana.com/">SES (Solar Energy Systems, LLC)</a>,
                    for being the go-to person for customers and employees.
                    <br><br>
                    Pushed SES in the R&D department in implementing <a href="https://www.victronenergy.com/">Victron 
                    Energy</a> equipment in our standard RV installations. Tested each
                    variation of equipment to ensure the prodcut is what the company needed.
                    <br><br>
                    Created over 300 electrical one-line drawings for SES to stand amongst
                    other professional competitors in the solar industry. These one-lines are
                    also used for submission for both state and utility forms when installing
                    solar.
                    <br><br>
                    Recently, I have been inspired by the effects of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR_f-iwUGY4">
                    Andrew Huberman's routine.</a> My productivity, energy level, and mood level has 
                    all increased significally ever since I started this routine. Even though I game 
                    less than an hour a day now, I am several times happier than I was before starting this routine.
                </p>
